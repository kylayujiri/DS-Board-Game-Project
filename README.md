# DS-Board-Game-Project

This repository contains the first project I made for my Data Structures course. The instructions for the project are found in the file *projectOneInstructions.pdf*.

Within the project folder, there is a folder *lib* which contains the JAR file *sourcecode.jar* provided by my professor. It contains classes for various data structures and algorithms. The license for use can be found within the JAR file. This project does not depend on *sourcecode.jar* as I have duplicated the DoublyLinkedList class and modified it for use in my project.
